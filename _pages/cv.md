Education
======
* M.S. in artificial intelligence, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Nehterlands
* B.S. in computer science, Camilo Jose Cela University, Madrid, Spain

Work experience
======
* Research data scientist @ TatonettiLab, Cedar Sinai 
  * Work on 10+ research projects in cancer and adverse drug events through ML and DL models.
  * Design and implement transformer models trained on genomics data to tackle different cancer challenges.
  * Zero shot and few shot approaches on LLMs to extract meaningful information from medical texts.
  * Research and implement novel methods for computational biomedicine based on the latest papers and innovations.
  * Supervise several student groups for DL/ML architecture implementation.
  * System administration for high performance compute

* Research AI engineer @ Massachussets General Hospital & Harvard Medical School
  * Worked on 8+ research projects developing machine learning and deep learning algorithms. From data preparation to evaluation.
  * Designed and implemented computer vision algorithms for lesion detection, and classification. Architectures included ResNet, EfficientNet,
and U‑Net, achieving remarkable results.
  * I developed a registry system of patients including 45.000+ images capable of categorizing x‑rays into 3 different sets of categories. It required
the collaboration of several people under my leadership.
  * Supported peer research projects with software architecture implementation and mentored them on machine learning techniques

* AI engineer @ In2A1
  * Addressed clients needs through artificial intelligence solutions, worked on 10+ different projects.
  * Designed and implemented machine learning architectures, met clients weekly, and followed agile methodologies.
  * Managed a group of developers for 2 web development projects based on open‑source frameworks, including APIs and Elasticsearch database.
  * Worked on CI/CD for several machine learning projects using GitLab, Docker, and scalable computing platforms
 
* Software Engineer @ Avaloq
  * Designed PL/SQL solutions for banks all over Europe. Worked with Avaloq code. Having limited functionalities fostered a creative and ingenious
environment to achieve complex tasks in the simplest ways possible.
  * Coded following the best standards to have reusable and scalable code. Implementations were used by 150+ banks worldwide.
  * Worked in a fast‑paced environment adapting to client’s needs and requests where teamwork played an important role
 
* Software engineer intern @ Telefónica
  * I was part of a team in charge of designing and coding a chatbot supported by machine learning. The aim was to facilitate real‑state advice
for the users.
  * Worked as a back‑end developer with APIs and microservicesand designed a CI/CD system with an API broker and docker, using GitLab
